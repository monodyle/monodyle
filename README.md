### Hi there 👋

<img src="./assets/me.png" align="right" height="128" />

From: Vietnam 🇻🇳

My name is Minh "Monody" Le Hong. Just a guy
tends to be handsome gradually over the years… 🐱

I was born a child of the mountains and forests, ⛰️
raised on the land of sunny which named Central Highlands.
Should be I had to grow 🥕 vegetables and 🐤 chickens,
but now I go 🧑‍💻 coding and 🧑‍🎨 design.
