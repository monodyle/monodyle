### Hi there 👋

<img src="./assets/me.png" align="right" height="128" />

From: Vietnam 🇻🇳

My name is Minh "Monody" Le Hong. Just a guy
tends to be handsome gradually over the years… 😎

I was born a child of the mountains and forests,
raised on the land of sunny which named Central Highlands.
Should be I had to grow vegetables and chickens,
but now I go coding and design.
